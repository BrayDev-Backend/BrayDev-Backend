👋 Hi, I'm Brayan Perez | Backend Developer in Training

Software Engineering Student & Boot.dev Learner
I'm an eighth-semester Software Engineering student with a sharp focus on backend systems. I'm currently advancing my practical, industry-ready skills through the intensive Backend Developer Path at Boot.dev, complementing my formal university education with hands-on, project-based learning.
🧠 About Me

    🎓 Final Year Software Engineering Student – Building a strong theoretical foundation in algorithms, data structures, and system design.

    🎯 Backend Enthusiast – Passionate about building scalable, efficient, and reliable server-side logic, APIs, and databases.

    🛠️ Practical Learner – I believe the best way to learn is by doing. I'm following the Boot.dev philosophy of "write code, not just tutorials," actively applying every concept through projects.

    🚀 Goal-Oriented – My current mission is to bridge academic knowledge with modern backend development practices to become job-ready.
